#### Big Projects
1. [Arxiv34k4l - Multi-label Text Classification Project](https://github.com/kelixirr/Arxiv34k4l/tree/main): Arxiv34k4l is a project aimed at building a multi-label text classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes data sourced from the ArXiv database, which contains a vast collection of academic papers spanning various disciplines. The project's main objective was to develop a model capable of effectively classifying academic papers into multiple categories simultaneously based on their abstracts reducing the workload of human reviewers who are often involved, and automating the process.
2. [Implementation of ResNet(v1)-20 on CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://github.com/kelixirr/AI-Projects/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20Projects/ResNet-20): In this project, I implemented and trained a ResNet-20 (Residual Network) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, based on the seminal paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. The objective was to classify images into 10 distinct classes using the ResNet-20 architecture, which addresses the vanishing gradient problem through the use of residual blocks and shortcut connections. To enhance the model's performance, I incorporated techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, and a custom learning rate scheduler. The model achieved an impressive test accuracy of 90.65%, demonstrating the effectiveness of residual learning for image recognition tasks and underscoring the power of deep neural networks in computer vision.
3. [Implementation of DenseNet-BC on CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://github.com/kelixirr/AI-Projects/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20Projects/DenseNet): In this project, I implemented and trained a DenseNet-BC (Densely Connected Convolutional Network) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, based on the influential paper "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks" by Gao Huang et al. The goal was to classify images into 10 classes using the DenseNet-BC architecture, which enhances information flow and mitigates the vanishing gradient problem through dense connectivity and bottleneck layers. Despite computational constraints, the model achieved test accuracy of 85.72% at 25 epochs out of 300, showcasing the robustness and effectiveness of the DenseNet architecture for image recognition tasks. Training did not happen for the entire epochs, model checkpoints were saved for the analysis. My default setup is DenseNet-BC with dropout but it also allows configurations to be adjusted for data augmentation, compression or bottleneck only. Additionally, one can also adjust various parameters like growth factor, depth, and blocks of the model.
