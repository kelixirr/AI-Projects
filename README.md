#### Big Projects
1. [Arxiv34k4l - Multi-label Text Classification Project](https://github.com/kelixirr/Arxiv34k4l/tree/main): Arxiv34k4l is a project aimed at building a multi-label text classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes data sourced from the ArXiv database, which contains a vast collection of academic papers spanning various disciplines. The project's main objective was to develop a model capable of effectively classifying academic papers into multiple categories simultaneously based on their abstracts reducing the workload of human reviewers who are often involved, and automating the process.
